# Ghidra
Ghidra is one of the most important tools for reverse engineering. Created by the NSA, it allows you to disassemble, decompile, and analyze binary files. Understanding Ghidra is essential for vulnerability research and binary exploitation.

## What is Ghidra?
Ghidra is a reverse engineering framework that provides:

- Disassembly: Converts machine code (binary) to assembly instructions.
- Decompilation: Converts assembly code to C-like pseudo-code for readability.
- Static Analysis: Analyzes binaries without running them (unlike debuggers like GDB).
