# Radare2 (r2)
Radare2 (r2) is one of the most powerful tools for reverse engineering. Unlike Ghidra, it is a command-line based tool, which gives you more control but also has a steeper learning curve. Radare2 is useful for analyzing ELF, PE, and binary files, and is heavily used in binary exploitation and vulnerability research.

## What Is Radare2?
Radare2 (r2) is an open-source reverse engineering framework with support for:

- Static Analysis: Disassemble binaries without running them.
- Dynamic Analysis: Attach to running processes, like GDB.
- Patching: Modify instructions directly in the binary.
- Emulation: Run instructions without full execution.

## Radare2 Interface Overview
Radare2 is command-line only, so learning its commands and workflow is crucial.
Here are the key modes and views youâ€™ll encounter.

| Mode                     | Command | Purpose                                       | 
| ------------------------ | ------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Visual Mode              | V       | Interactive view of disassembly.              | 
| Hexdump View             | px      | Shows raw hex bytes of the binary.            | 
| Disassembler View        | pdf     | Shows disassembled instructions.              |
| Pseudo-code View         | pdc     | Displays C-like decompiled code.              |
| CFG (Control Flow Graph) | VV      | Shows a graphical control flow of a function. |
| Scriptable Commands      | r2pipe  | Allows scripting via Python.                  |
